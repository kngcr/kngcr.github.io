## With Bootstrap…

I can hasten the tedious process of web page development. UI Frameworks like Bootstrap provide pre-built components, which eliminate the need to build complex UI elements from scratch. An example of such a component can be seen by the navbar in the example image.

## With Bootstrap…

I can create responsive designs. UI Frameworks like Bootstrap offer built-in responsive UI elements that would otherwise take additional manual styling in HTML/CSS. It is important for web pages to be responsive because it allows for automatic adjustment to different screen sizes to benefit the user’s experience. Along with the previous point, the ability to apply a useful UI element easily speeds up the webpage development process.

## With Bootstrap…

I can be consistent with a design. UI Frameworks like Bootstrap ensure consistent styling across all components through the way it pre-built said components. Unless a class is written to override the default Bootstrap classes for implementing various UI elements, the default styles adhere to Bootstrap’s design principles. Using raw HTML/CSS would lead to many inconsistencies because every little detail of a component’s implementation would lead to a different outcome. Frameworks avoid this messy result.

## With Bootstrap…

I do not need to be a master of JavaScript. This sentence is meant to be humorous, but it is true that UI Frameworks like Bootstrap include built-in JavaScript functionality. All it requires is including Bootstrap JS and adding the attributes needed.

## With Bootstrap…

I have access to peer guidance and support. Bootstrap is a popular UI Framework that has an active community and extensive documentation. Both of these social aspects enable Bootstrap to be a valid tool to a web developer and render custom development to be unnecessary. If you develop a custom navbar and need help with a formatting issue, it would be harder to assist with than if this format adhered to a framework.

## …my code will flow

As complex as it is to learn the nuances of UI Frameworks like Bootstrap, it is beneficial to software development as long as these tools will provide better efficiency and quality. The way that pre-built functionality hastens the process and consistent styling is a provided feature, the ROI is worth it. Instead of putting the time and effort into coding, frameworks give developers the flexibility to refocus this investment elsewhere. Hence, ‘my code will flow’ via this freedom.
