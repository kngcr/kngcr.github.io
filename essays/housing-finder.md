## Overview

**The Problem:** UH’s out-of-state students, who are in search of affordable housing outside of dormitories, are faced with several challenges. Students that do not have connections with local residents will struggle to find trustworthy landlords to contact. To lower living costs, these students will also have to actively find suitable roommates to live with on their own. That is another hurdle. Safety is a crucial concern for students that must live on their own- miles of ocean away from family- especially with the recent rise of criminal activity around the Manoa campus (the most populated campus).

**The Solution:** A housing finder website that will help students connect with other students to find roommates, and to also help cultivate a community of trusted landlords that can offer housing for student tenants. This idea would benefit a community of people that need to rent out land and benefit students that need a place to stay. Safety can be ensured through confirming each person’s identity on their profile is verified and up-to-date. Potentially, different account roles can be included: landlords, guests, users, admin. There is also the potential of sharing geolocation as a feature to show how far users are from prospective renters using React.

## Names of the proposers

Our group: Ciara Kang, Deolian Domawa, Trevell Pruitt, Kyle Aipoalani, Michael Lee

## Mockup page ideas

The Housing Finder website will include but are not limited to:
* Landing page
* Admin home page
* Landlord home page
* User home page
* Guest home page (default if not logged in)
* User Profile page
* Landlord Profile page
* Categories page
* Category page
* Create Listing page (listing a property for rent)
* Property page
* Notify admin page

## Use case ideas

Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.

* New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile. (How do they learn how system works?)
* New landlord goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile, add listings. (How do they learn how system works?)
* Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.
* User goes to landing page, logs in, browses categories, finds listing, contacts landlord.
* Landlord goes to landing page, logs in, contacts user that is interested, edits listing. (Put on hold)
* User and Landlord interact to confirm deal.
* Landlord and admin interact to remove listing. (Prevent ghosting and fraud)
* Landlord and admin interact to ban inappropriate usage.
* User and admin interact to ban inappropriate usage.


## Beyond the basics

After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:

* A rating system for renters and past tenants.
* Map-based interface to show where properties are from every UH campus.
