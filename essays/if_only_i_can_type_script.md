## My initial thoughts

On TypeScript, the option to declare variable types or let TS infer variable types was the most appealing aspect to me. As someone new to TS, this flexibility provides a breath of fresh air. The ability to declare variable types is different from JavaScript, which does not require it. On the other hand, C and C++ require you to declare variable types. While I do prefer the latter and I understand it is also highly recommended, I believe TS’s ability to infer types is indicative of the future with machine learning. That is, the ability to predict a programmer’s intention behind their code is beneficial to software developers. That on top of how TS is a superset of JS– meaning JS but with more features– I believe TS to be a good programming language from a software engineering perspective.

(I would like to acknowledge the fact that my knowledge of TypeScript is still limited, so my opinions may change as I diversify my skill set.)

## Pedagogy in CS

I found the concept of athletic software engineering to be logical and I support it, however, whether the practice of athletic software engineering through timed WODs is practical is to be stated. As of this post, I had my first experience with an actual WOD on top of the practice WODs assigned to the class. While my initial experience was good (everyone in my section completed the WOD before DNF time), I have heard from upperclassmen that WODs become much more challenging (i.e. duplicate a website in two ways with Bootstrap 5 and React). On one hand, I do believe that testing my individual coding skills and ability to adapt within a timed period is essential. It replicates the work environment while also encouraging us as future developers to stay competitive. 

On the other hand, I do not want to underestimate the importance of being able to work as a team. In the future, we as software developers will have to work with one another to develop large-scale programs. In my ICS 212 course, my professor emphasized this aspect and organized the class to complete several large group projects. Was it more time consuming and challenging in its own right? Yes, it definitely was.

Now, I am aware that with how WODs are designed, it would be counterintuitive to work as a group to solve official problems. It may even cause less incentive to prepare for WODs should they become a group effort in every case. But I do argue that with the availability of AI and the internet, the individual effort may not entirely be benefitted. **Efficiency for time would triumph over the quality of code.** An example of this would be the ease of hard coding return statements via copy & paste (a bad beginner habit) instead of reducing redundancy through assigning a value to a variable and then returning a string template.

## Time > Quality?

I believe that the consistency of a weekly practice WOD and official WOD will work to my benefit. Consistent coding is the best way to retain coding knowledge. I acknowledge that some WODs were taken directly from sources that utilize WODs as a test in the application process. In that way, WODs are only beneficial. The time constraint is a concern. I worry that proper coding practices will be set aside for pure efficiency. Only time will tell… because there are guidelines in place for what is expected of the code. It will keep me on my toes– emphasizing the importance of reading the fine print and adhering to instructions carefully.
